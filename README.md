# Travel Assistant Chatbot (DSA4213 Project)

## Overview
This project builds a **lightweight, domain-specific chatbot** for answering travel FAQs and destination queries efficiently.  
It demonstrates **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **prompt-based learning** using small pretrained models (Flan-T5 small).

### Key Features
- **Prompt-only baseline** using Flan-T5 Small.
- **RAG-lite chatbot** with FAISS retrieval on a curated travel knowledge base.
- **Evaluation** via semantic similarity (cosine) and human ratings.
- **Compact & efficient**, designed for low compute environments.
